        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Climbing</h2>
        <p>I have been climbing since my university days in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings. Whilst working as an outdoor activity instructor, I was able to develop my love of climbing into teaching the sport to others.</p>
        <p>I got injured working at the outdoor centre, so was not able to climb for around 10 years after my job there, but I have recently been able to restart. I have been enjoying getting back into the challenge of bouldering problems, and plan to start outdoor climbing again this summer.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <h3>Singing</h3>
        <p>I started singing lessons when I got injured and couldn't do the sports and activities I had previously enjoyed. I have been having lessons for around 8 years now, and have progressed to a Grade 6-7 level.</p>
        <h3>Music Production</h3>
        <p>I have been writing my own songs since I was a teenager, but over the past year I have been learning how to arrange these into recordings via music production software.</p>
